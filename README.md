## I am studying Applied Computer Science at AGH in Cracow (currently second year). <br>
Still trying to decide on my specialization, mabe something with embedded systems and microcontrollers, or something closer to software developement, but I am not sure, yet. <br>
<br>
My first programming language was Python. I was learninig it while I was in middle school, but later on I didnt use it much so I forgot many things about it. 
I wrote some websites, when I was in high school, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and also PHP.
Currently in collage, I continue to learn C++ and so far, it's my favorite programming language.
