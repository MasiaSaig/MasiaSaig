## I am studying Applied Computer Science at AGH in Cracow (currently second year). <br>
Still trying to decide on my specialization, mabe something with embedded systems and microcontrollers, or something closer to software developement, but I am not completely sure, yet. <br>
<br>
My first programming language was Python. I was learninig it while I was in middle school, but later on I didnt use it much so I forgot many things about it. <br>
I wrote some websites, when I was in high school, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and also PHP. <br>
Currently in collage, I continue to learn C++ and so far, it's my favorite programming language, bacause I belive it has is challenging and gives me a steady ground for me to learn other programming languages. <br>
I belive, I am tenacious at what I do and I try to spend my time on learning and working as best as I can. 

### Some projects ###
Together with my brother, we added some features and new tab on a website, for Okocim parish. Other than that, we made a simple website hosted online, for Stowarzyszenie Okocim od Serca: https://okocim.serv00.net/.
