### Future plans ### -->
<!--
I was thinking of getting to know C# together with .Net Framework, because I see it very often used in some desktop applications. So I thought it would be nice to know, how to quickly create some simple (or even some more advanced) programs to share with my friends and create their sometimes silly application ideas. <br>
--> 
<!--
In further future, I want to buy some pcb, mabe like an arduino or raspberry pi, just to get started and try it out. But I do not have any project ideas, for now. I was also wondering, if using a regular circuit board would be better, as it would surly be more challanging, since I would also have to learn more about electronics and circuit design.
