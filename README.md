## I am studying Applied Computer Science at AGH in Cracow (currently second year). <br>
Still trying to decide on my specialization, mabe something with embedded systems and microcontrollers, or something closer to software development, but I am not completely sure, yet. <br>
<br>
My first programming language was Python. I started learning it while I was in middle school, but later on I didnt use it much so I forgot many things about it. <br>
I wrote some websites, when I was in high school, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and also PHP. <br>
Currently in collage, I continue to learn C++ and so far, it's my favorite programming language, bacause I belive it is challenging and gives me a steady ground for  learning other programming languages. <br>
<br>
I belive, I am persistent at what I do and I try to spend my time on learning and working as best as I can. 

### Some projects ###
Together with my brother, we added some features and new tab on a website, for Okocim parish. Other than that, we made a simple website hosted online, for Stowarzyszenie Okocim od Serca: https://okocim.serv00.net/.

### Currently ###
I am learning Qt QML with QtQuick, for creating multiplatform applications and UI Design.

### What I plan on learning in near future ###
<!--
I was thinking of getting to know C# together with .Net Framework, because I see it very often used in some desktop applications. So I thought it would be nice to know, how to quickly create some simple (or even some more advanced) programs to share with my friends and create their sometimes silly application ideas. <br>
-->
In further future, I want to buy some pcb, like an arduino or raspberry pi one, just to get started and try it out. But I do not have any project ideas, for now. I was also wondering, if using a regular circuit board would be better, as it would surly be more challanging, since I would also have to learn more about electronics and circuit design.
